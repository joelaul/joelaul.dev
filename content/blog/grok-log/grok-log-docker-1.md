## As I studied an open-source codebase with intent to contribute, I used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) as a note-taking tool. This is my side of one of our conversations.

---

Explain the following three files and how they work together in this open-source codebase. I'm assuming they were used to start the production server on Heroku, because I used Next's dev server during development.

Makefile:

```
dev:
    docker compose up --build --remove-orphans --renew-anon-volumes
```
docker-compose.yml:

```
version: '3.7'

services:
app:
    build:
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
    - ./src:/app/src
    ports:
    - 3000:3000
```

Dockerfile:

```
FROM node:18.16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies.
COPY package.json .
COPY yarn.lock .
RUN yarn install

# Copy config.
COPY next.config.js .
COPY postcss.config.js .
COPY tailwind.config.js .
COPY tsconfig.json .

# Copy the application code.
COPY public public
COPY src src

# Run the application.
CMD [ "yarn", "dev" ]
```

Sounds about right. So the app ran inside a container, as it probably would be via Render, but the container had to be provided and configured by the developer -- so it's basically one abstraction layer lower than Render?

---

Does Render in fact run its servers in docker containers? I know that it builds on AWS infrastructure, as most serverless platforms do, but the approach is unclear. I know that the web server itself is Nginx, which serves your app's production assets, but I wasn't sure if the environment instance was OS- or hardware-level.

---

So to clarify, does Heroku require configuration / provision of the container as the author had done here, or does it offer the option to abstract this as with Render?

---

Was this choice likely out of familiarity with the platform or intent for control?
