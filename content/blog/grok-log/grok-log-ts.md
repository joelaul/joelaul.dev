## As I studied an open-source codebase with intent to contribute, I used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) as a note-taking tool. This is my side of one of our conversations.

Break down this typescript function syntax:

```
// imports class "$gql" from barrelled $gql.ts
import * as graphql from "../lib/graphql"; 

export const useGql = <G extends graphql.Any$gql>(
gql: G
): [exec: Exec<G>, res: GqlRes<G>, cancel: xhr.Cancel, reset: xhr.Reset] => { ... }
```

---

so here, the vertical bars separate all possible types that GqlRes can be? Is this a union type?

```
export type GqlRes<G extends graphql.Any$gql> = 
| {
    status: GqlStatus.Init;
    }
| {
    status: GqlStatus.Pending;
    }
| {
    status: GqlStatus.Success;
    data: graphql.SuccessfulResponse<G>["data"];
    }
| {
    status: GqlStatus.Errors;
    errors: string[];
    }
| {
    status: GqlStatus.Cancelled;
    };
```
